This is Markdown text. As part of our work, we consider a very truncated subset of this markup language. Text can be divided into paragraphs, leaving 1 (one) empty line between paragraphs.

We can make the text * * bold * *, make it _ italic _ or 'fixed width'. It is also possible to save fragments of preformatted text:
```
This text is preformatted.
This means that it will appear as is, and no other formatting, such as * * bold * * or _ italic _ on it
influences.      And here all spaces, indents and line wrap are stored as is
```
